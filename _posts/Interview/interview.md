# A short interview with @R4GUL#8503, the author of the challenge SIGINT
## Tell me a bit about yourself.
> I play CTFs and I am a part of CTFSG.
## What got you into hardware?
> I actually started off doing robotics before I started doing cyber.
## What is the most interesting hardware-related thing you've done?
> [I've built my own CPU in (around) 2020.](https://youtu.be/LINIAREkKwo)
## Why and how did you make this challenge?
> There aren't many hardware challenges in CTFs, so I decided to do it for greater diversity. How did I do it? I built a setup, got a signal analyser, and just got a voltage signal. ![Setup](images/setup.jpg)
## Any last words?
> Not much. I hope more people are interested in hardware.
