# What have I been up to?
I'm starting university, and between the six month gap between this post and the last post I've done a bunch of things.

- Contributing to the Centuria GitHub repository
- Working on a bunch of side projects, but no progress
- Studying stuff related to computing, economics and mathematics

# My contributions to the Centuria repo
Centuria is a Java server that allows people to play the game [Feral (use cntr+F)](https://www.guv1.com/professional-1/2019/4/26/uden-22-wildworks-studio-networking) after its servers closed, something akin to Club Penguin private servers. \(To be clear, my contributions did not contain anything cryptocurrency or blockchain related.\)

I contributed to the project because I was always fascinated with the idea of game hacking.

My contributions are as follows:
- Reimplementing server-side support for minor room editing features
- Reimplementing server-side support for minigames

It was very difficult because:
- Studying the game's behaviour is difficult because the game's code is obfuscated
- I didn't know how to debug Java programs in my IDE of choice

# Progress on other side projects
- **IR blaster that controls lights:** Progress stalled due to difficulty with writing C++ code, as well as technical issues with electrical components.
- **Loop Labyrinth:** I haven't done anything with it because its about complicated math, and I have made the decision to private the repository containing its code.

# Topology
I now have a better idea of what topology is. **Topology is the study of how points within a set of points are close to each other, even when there is no way to calculate the distance between them** (in which case you just keep track of every possible combination of points that can be grouped together like neighbours, such that you can combine these combinations using set operations and still get a valid combination).

Shapes are sets of points. Homeomorphisms are functions that take one point from a shape and assigns it to another point in another shape. This is useful, because, for example, two shapes that are homeomorphic (a type of congruence) have the same number of holes, like a donut-shape and a cup-shape.

**My game Loop Labyrinth is about how you can represent 3D shapes by taking a square and gluing together the sides,** which is possible as the square is homemorphic to the shape.

...

In any case, I'll be writing about something more interesting next time. See you there.
