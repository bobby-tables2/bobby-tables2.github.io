> # Context:
> [SCSE CC](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/news-events/events/detail/2021/11/22/default-calendar/scse-computing-challenge-2022) is a competition that invites teams of students to work on a computing project. 
> For 2022, we were tasked to program a robot car to travel along a path based on shape instructions that it sees with a camera.
> I was assigned the role of writing the algorithm for detecting shapes.

The whole process took me about a month or two to complete, and I tried to take photos in random conditions to help improve the algorithm. Testing was done on a Raspberry Pi as that was the platform used by the robot car.

The algorithm was written in Python.

# Libraries used:
- **scipy.spatial.dist** was used to calculate the distance between 2 colour points.
- **numpy** was used to speed up calculations on matrices (since images are like 2D matrices).
- **cv2** and **imutils** was used to conduct image processing.

# Rough Description of Algorithm: ![Step 0](/assets/images/2023-1-3-SCSE-CC/step0.png)
1. Image is blurred to remove noise. ![Step 1](/assets/images/2023-1-3-SCSE-CC/step1.png)
2. All regions outside of white regions (paper) are removed. ![Step 2](/assets/images/2023-1-3-SCSE-CC/step2.png)
3. White regions are removed to isolate shapes. ![Step 3](/assets/images/2023-1-3-SCSE-CC/step3.png)
4. Pure red, green and blue (all possible colours for shapes) are exaggerated to further isolate shapes. ![Step 4](/assets/images/2023-1-3-SCSE-CC/step4.png)
5. [Otsu's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu's_method) is used to ensure there are only non-shape pixels and shape pixels. ![Step 5](/assets/images/2023-1-3-SCSE-CC/step5.png)
6. Gradient around the edges of shape are calculated to determine how many points they have. (This part was largely taken from the internet) ![Step 6](/assets/images/2023-1-3-SCSE-CC/step6.png)
7. Shape and colour of shape is determined.
- Triangles have 3 points, squares have 4 points, and anything with more points is considered a circle.
- Red, green or blue colour is determined by the shape's colour's [euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) from each other. ![Euclidean distance in colour space](/assets/images/2023-1-3-SCSE-CC/euclidean_distance.png)
